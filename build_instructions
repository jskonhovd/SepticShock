# Spark Instruction:
sbt/sbt compile "run --executor-memory 4g --driver-memory 10g"

This project was developed like our Spark homeworks in class. SBT should be the only requirement.

# Machine Learning Instructions
python project_predictive_modeling.py
python project_my_model.py

I used python 2.7. The models will need the results of the spark job.

The spark job will generate an spark_output folder. These are the results.
