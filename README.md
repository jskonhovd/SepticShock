# SepticShockML

1. The goal of this project was to build a Machine Learning model to predict Septic shock in an emergency room
environment using MIMIC3 database.

2. This projected was organized using an Modeling Pipeline which included all the stages in building a ML model. This
included stages such as Predictive Target, Cohort Construction, Feature Construction, Feature Selection, Predictive
Model, and Performance Evaluation.

3. The predictive models were constructed using scikit-learn, and included algorithms such as neural networks, decision
trees, and AdaBoost.
