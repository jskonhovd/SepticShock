# SepticShockML

– The goal of this project was to build a Machine Learning model to predict Septic shock in an emergency room
environment using MIMIC3 database.
– This projected was organized using an Modeling Pipeline which included all the stages in building a ML model. This
included stages such as Predictive Target, Cohort Construction, Feature Construction, Feature Selection, Predictive
Model, and Performance Evaluation.
– The predictive models were constructed using scikit-learn, and included algorithms such as neural networks, decision
trees, and AdaBoost.
